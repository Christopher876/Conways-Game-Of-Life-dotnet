# Conways-Game-Of-Life-dotnet

This is a project written using C#.net. It utilizes SFML to render its graphics. Thus making it cross platform with our three main desktop platforms.
The goals of this project are to:
- Show how something simple can make something very complex.
- Optimizing code and rendering graphics by using more lower level objects such as, Vertex Arrays.
- Properly write C# XML documentation for every function.
